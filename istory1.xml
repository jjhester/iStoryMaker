                    <p>He was a priest with no religion after his wife's death.</p>
                    <p>He had three kids. One was a little girl who left half-drunken glasses of water around the room. Another was a teenage baseball star, who was now a dropout. Finally, there was the asthmatic boy. Together, they were a family, broken but functional.</p>
                    <p>One day, his daughter told him of an alien in the pantry. What should the priest dad do?</p>
